# NCBI__NtDb_GenBank_Parser
Parses GenBank files from the NCBI nucleotide database using accession number and email address associated with NCBI account. Is capable of outputting a .txt file containing basic sequence information, source, CDS, and gene feature dictionaries as well as generate a linear gene map visualizing all of the aforementioned information. 

When accessing GenBank files with many feature dictionaries, the linear gene map may be cluttered and have many overlapping values, zooming in may be the best option at this point while I work on a solution.

Need to (pip) install biopython and plotly.
